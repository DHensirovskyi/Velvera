Velvera — Lightweight Assistant for Salons & Small Businesses

Velvera is a tiny, no-nonsense product tour of an assistant that handles bookings, email confirmations, one-click cancellations, reminders, Google-review nudges, and simple owner analytics. It’s built to demo the core flows you’d actually use with real clients.

Why it exists

Salons lose money on no-shows and forget to ask for reviews. Velvera focuses on two outcomes:

Fewer no-shows via instant confirmations + reminders (day before & 2 hours before)

More reviews with a clean “Review on Google” flow

Everything else is supporting cast: a friendly form, a one-click cancel link, and a simple daily/weekly view for the owner.
